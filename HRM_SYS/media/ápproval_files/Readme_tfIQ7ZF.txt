Developed by: Nelson Pires

Description:
------------------------
The original eye saver app designed to provide brightness controls for
CRT/LCD/TFT/LED and all other type of screens. Useful for working in
low light conditions where too much screen brightness is undesirable
and bad for the eyes. Helping to save the eyesight and eye strain of
thousands of users since 2007.

It's a portable app:
 - Runs without installation
 - Simply delete the program file(s) when not needed anymore
   > Note that you have to disable the option "Auto run" if enabled
     before deleting the program file(s), or, you'll be left with a
     reference to the program that you have to remove manually.

Special notes:
------------------------
If the program fails to create the config file, you could be in a
privileged/protected folder. Run as Administrator or from another folder.

When your monitors are not connected directly to your graphics card or
motherboard (expansion cards, dongles, docking stations, etc.), Dimmer
MIGHT not detect them or correctly determine its resolution/boundaries.
